This is a front end to accompany the backend I made in the Coursera IBM Full Stack Certificate Node.js course.

This react app accesses data on books that allows users to browse the books, search by author, search by title.
The search uses autocomplete based on the existing books in the data.

The UI has components for displaying the book details, a header, a footer, the search by title, search by author and 
to submit a review, register and login.

The site uses bootstrap for CSS and uses alerts and custom styling to make the site for user friendly.

This extended the things I learned in the react portion of the course work and works nicely with the back end.

Next steps might be to move the data to a mongoDB.
